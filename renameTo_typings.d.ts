// here you will define the types of your graphql 
// just like stepzen does, the difference with this is
// that you could use them into the frontend app 

/** similar like this:
 * 
 * 
type NameOfType = {

    all the fields and what the value should be
    name: string;
    lastname: string
    age: number

    and so on
}

the data here is the similar stepzen generates for you
